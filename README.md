  <h2>Welcome to my profile!</h2>
</div>

My name is Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez and I am a Data Scientist from Madrid, Spain. I am a very curious person, always in touch with the new technologies. Although I studied Journalism, I found my passion in Data Science when I discovered it in the football world.

I'm a recent graduate of the Data Science Bootcamp in The Bridge, where I completed an intensive program in data science and analytics. With a background in communication, I've always been interested in how data can be used to inform decision-making and tell compelling stories. Throughout my education, I've gained expertise in statistics, programming, and data visualization, and have completed several projects demonstrating my skills in these areas.
