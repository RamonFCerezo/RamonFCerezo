  <h2>Welcome to my profile!</h2>

<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez and I am a Data Scientist from Madrid, Spain. I am a very curious person, always in touch with the new technologies. Although I studied Journalism, I found my passion in Data Science when I discovered it in the football world.</p>
<p> I'm a recent graduate of the Data Science Bootcamp in The Bridge, where I completed an intensive program in data science and analytics. With a background in communication, I've always been interested in how data can be used to inform decision-making and tell compelling stories. Throughout my education, I've gained expertise in statistics, programming, and data visualization, and have completed several projects demonstrating my skills in these areas.</p>

<h2> Interests </h2>
<ul>
  <li> I find it fascinating to explore and showcase data visually. I enjoy analyzing large datasets, creating interactive dashboards, using visualization libraries and designing informative graphs and charts. In a nutshell, <strong>making data accesible to everyone</strong>.</li>
  <li> I have a strong interest in the development of predictive models and algorithms. I enjoy exploring machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.</li>
  <li> Due to my communication background, I find it fulfilling to work with text data and developing NLP models to extract insights from unstructured text. I have experience in developing chatbots, sentiment analysis models, and text classification models using NLP techniques such as tokenization or lemmatization.</li>
  <li> I am eager to find a new challenge in Data Science that helps me grow as a professional.</li>
  <li> In my free time I enjoy playing football, paddle tennis, but also watching Formula 1 and reading books.</li>
